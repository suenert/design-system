# Fragment

This concept is based on react [fragments](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html).

The abstract tells us what this pattern tries to achieve:

> A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

Fragments don't exist natively in vue, so we need this component to mimic their behaviour.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Compnent"
    render={(args) => ({
      components: { Fragment },
      setup() {
        return { args };
      },
      template: ` <Fragment> <p>hi 1</p> <p>hi 2</p> <p>hi 3</p> </Fragment> `,
    })}
  />
</Canvas>
